        <p id="bio"> My name is Monica White and I love art, anime, horses, Harley's and working hard. I
            love to go to Comic-Con and Cosplay at Anime Conventions. I have 2 boys and they both are very smart and
            brilliant. I love to draw and paint just about anything, however, realism and anime are my specialties. I
            love
            Horseback Riding because it gives me a sense of peace and freedom. I will one day own a Harley Davidson
            Motorcycle and ride off into the sunset like I've always dreamed I would. One of my dreams is to pursue
            Coding and see what endless possibilities it will take me. I believe I can accomplish anything I set my mind
            too and believe I can and will accomplish this once in a lifetime major comeback opportunity.</p>
